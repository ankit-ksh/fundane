#!/usr/bin/bash

# Description:
# This script is designed to back up common Linux configuration files (e.g., shell, mpv, i3, TLP, GRUB) on Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based systems.
# It creates a backup folder, copies configuration files, and lists the user-installed software.
# The script is general and can be scheduled for automatic backups via cron jobs or systemd timers.

# Usage:
# 1. Save the script to a file (e.g., backup_configs.sh).
# 2. Make it executable: chmod +x backup_configs.sh
# 3. Run the script: ./backup_configs.sh
# 4. Schedule automatic backups with cron jobs or systemd timers.

# Schedule with cron (example to run at 3 AM daily):
# crontab -e
# 0 3 * * * /path/to/backup_configs.sh

# Schedule with systemd timers (example can be added to your system's systemd timer unit files)

# Define the backup folder
folder="$HOME/linux_backup_files"

# Create the backup folder if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$folder" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$folder"
  echo "Created backup folder at $folder"
fi

# Backup common configuration files
cp ~/.bashrc "$folder/"
cp ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf "$folder/"
cp /etc/tlp.conf "$folder/"
cp /etc/default/grub "$folder/"

# Backup the entire MPV configuration folder
if [ -d ~/.config/mpv ]; then
  cp -r ~/.config/mpv/ "$folder/mpv/"
  echo "MPV configuration folder backed up."
else
  echo "MPV configuration folder not found. Skipping MPV backup."
fi

# Backup i3 Configuration Folder
if [ -d ~/.config/i3 ]; then
  cp -r ~/.config/i3/ "$folder/i3/"
  echo "i3 configuration folder backed up."
else
  echo "i3 configuration directory not found. Skipping i3 backup."
fi

# Backup legacy i3 config folder (~/.i3)
if [ -d ~/.i3 ]; then
  cp -r ~/.i3/ "$folder/i3_legacy/"
  echo "Legacy i3 configuration folder backed up."
else
  echo "Legacy i3 configuration directory (~/.i3) not found. Skipping legacy i3 backup."
fi

# List installed software using dpkg (Ubuntu-based systems)
dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > "$folder/installed_software.txt"
echo "List of installed software saved to $folder/installed_software.txt"

echo "Backup completed successfully. All files are saved in $folder."
